ingredients:
  - item: russet potatoes
    qty: 4.5
    unit: lb
  - item: onion
    qty: 5
    unit: c
    prep: diced
  - item: eggs
    qty: 4
  - item: matzo meal
    qty: 1.25
    unit: c
  - item: kosher salt
    qty: 2
    unit: T
  - item: canola or peanut oil
  - item: apple sauce
    optional: yes
  - item: sour cream
    optional: yes
procedure:
  - Shred potatoes with food processor, squeezing water out of every 2-3 with
    cheesecloth as you go. Reserve the water and transfer shredded potato to
    another bowl. Add diced onion to the potatoes.
  - Let the potato water stand undisturbed until a slurry forms beneath a layer
    of water. Drain off the water, then mix the remaining starch into the potato
    and onion mixture with hands.
  - Alternate adding an egg, 1/4 cup of matzo meal, and salt until the mixture
    can be formed into patties that just stick together.
  - Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until a
    potato shred immediately bubbles when added to pan. Form a single latke and
    fry on both sides until golden brown to taste and adjust seasonings as
    needed.
  - Form latke mix into patties 4 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick in the
    center. Fry, no more than four at once, until golden brown on the bottom and
    flip with a slotted spatula until the same color is achieved on the other
    side. Flip as needed to get a firm, darker-than-golden crust on both sides.
  - Transfer cooked latkes to a sheet pan lined with paper towels to cool 2
    minutes, then serve with apple sauce and sour cream.

Once the salt has been added to the potato mixture, the latkes should be cooked
immediately as this will begin to extract further moisture from the potatoes and
onions.
