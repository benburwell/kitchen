yield: 4 servings
ingredients:
  - item: fennel bulbs
    qty: 2
  - item: small waxy potatoes
    qty: 1.25
    unit: lb
  - item: extra virgin olive oil
  - item: kosher salt
  - item: freshly ground black pepper

    qty: 12
    unit: oz
  - item: 10-oz whole sea bass or porgy
    qty: 4
    prep: gutted, trimmed, and scaled
  - item: fresh flat-leaf parsley
    prep: roughly chopped
  - item: lemon
    qty: 0.5
    prep: juiced
procedure:
  - Trim the fennel bulbs, reserving the fronds, and remove any tough outer
    leaves. Quarter and cut out the central core. Cut each piece into slice,
    about 1/8 inch thick lengthwise.
  - Preheat the oven to 375 F. Cut the potatoes into rounds of the same
    thickness. Lay the fennel in a roasting pan or large ovenproof serving dish
    that will hold the fish in a single layer. Pour on 1 T olive oil, season
    with salt and pepper, and turn the fennel over with your hands making sure
    it's well coated.
  - Lay the potatoes on the fennel, season, and drizzle with 2 T olive oil. Set
    the tomatoes on top. Season the tomatoes and drizzle oil on them too. Bake
    for 20 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, wash the fish and cut three slashes in the flesh on each side.
    Season inside and out with salt and pepper and put half the parsley in
    them.
  - When the vegetables have been baking for 20 minutes, lay the fish on top of
    the potatoes and fennel (push the tomatoes out of the way to make room),
    season with salt and pepper, and drizzle a little oil on each fish. Roast
    for another 15 minutes. The fish is cooked when the flesh near the bone is
    white and opaque.
  - Squeeze the lemon juice over the vegetables and fish, sprinkle on the rest
    of the parsley, and serve immediately.
