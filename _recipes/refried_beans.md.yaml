yield: 4 cups
ingredients:
  - item: dried pinto or black beans
    qty: 0.5
    unit: lb
  - item: epazote
    qty: 2
    unit: t
  - item: medium white onion
    qty: 0.5
    prep: minced 
  - item: medium white onion
    qty: 0.5
    prep: left whole
  - item: garlic cloves
    qty: 2
  - item: lard, bacon drippings, canola oil, or butter
    qty: 6
    unit: T
  - item: salt 
procedure:
  - In a large pot, cover the beans with cold water by at least 2 inches. Add herb sprigs, the whole onion half, and garlic cloves and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to simmer and cook until beans are very tender, about 1 to 2 hours.
  - Season with salt. Drain beans, reserving bean-cooking liquid. You should have about 3 cups of cooked beans; if you have more, measure out 3 cups of beans and reserve the rest for another use. Discard herb sprigs, onion, and garlic.
  - In a large skillet, heat lard, bacon drippings, or oil until shimmering, or butter until foaming, over medium-high heat. Add minced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and lightly golden, about 7 minutes. 
  - Stir in beans and cook for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of reserved bean-cooking liquid. Smash the beans to form a chunky puree or use an immersion blender for a smoother puree.
  - Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring, until desired consistency is reached; if refried beans are too dry, add more bean-cooking liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed. Season with salt and serve.
