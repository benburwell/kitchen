ingredients:
- item: potatoes
  qty: 2
  unit: lbs
  prep: peeled and cut into 1/8-inch slices
- item: extra virgin olive oil
  qty: 6
  unit: T
  divided: yes
- item: kosher salt
- item: freshly ground black pepper
- item: cod fillets
  qty: 1.5
  unit: lbs
  prep: skinned, about 1-inch thick, in 2 or more pieces
preheat: 400
procedure:
  - Toss potatoes in an 8-by-12-inch or similar size baking pan with 4
    tablespoons of the oil or butter. Season with salt and pepper, spread
    evenly, and place the pan in a 400ยบ oven for about 40 minutes or until
    potatoes are tender and have begun to brown on top.
  - Remove the potatoes from the oven. Turn on the broiler, and adjust the rack
    so that it is 4 to 6 inches from the heat source.
  - Top the potatoes with the fish, drizzle with the remaining oil or butter and
    sprinkle with some more salt and pepper. Broil until the fish is done, 6 to
    10 minutes, depending on its thickness (a thin-bladed knife will pass
    through it easily). If at any point the top of the potatoes begins to burn,
    move the pan a couple of inches farther away from the heat source.
