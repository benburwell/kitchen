    qty: 1
    unit: t
  - item: freshly ground black pepper
  - item: chicken stock
    qty: 3
    unit: qt
  - item: carrot and celery for garnish
    prep: finely diced
procedure:
  - In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs with seltzer and schmaltz. In a small
    bowl, stir together matzo meal with baking powder, salt, and pepper. Add
    dry ingredients to wet ingredients and stir to combine thoroughly.
    Refrigerate uncovered for 30 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, divide stock evenly between two pots and bring to a simmer. Add
    diced carrots and celery to one pot.
  - Using wet hands, form matzo mixture into 1- to 1 1/2-inch balls and add to
    the simmering stock that doesn't have the carrots and celery. When all
    matzo balls are added, cover and simmer until matzo balls are cooked
    through, about an hour. Cooked matzo balls can be kept warm in their broth
    until ready to serve.
  - Using a slotted spoon, transfer matzo balls to serving bowls (at least
    three per bowl); strain matzo-ball-cooking broth and save for another use.
    Ladle hot clear borth with carrots and celery into each bowl. Serve.
