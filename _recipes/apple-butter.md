procedure:
  - Wash, remove stems, quarter and core fruit.
  - Cook slowly in cider and vinegar until soft.
  - Press fruit through a colander, food mill, or strainer.
  - Cook fruit pulp with sugar and spices, stirring frequently. To test for
    doneness, remove a spoonful and hold it away from steam for 2 minutes. It is
    done if the butter remains mounded on the spoon. Another way to determine
    when the butter is cooked adequately is to spoon a small quantity onto a
    plate. When a rim of liquid does not separate around the edge of the butter,
    it is ready for canning.
  - Fill hot into sterile half-pint or pint jars, leaving Â¼-inch headspace.
    Quart jars need not be presterilized. Adjust lids and process according to
    the table below.
