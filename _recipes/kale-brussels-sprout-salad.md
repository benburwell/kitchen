procedure:
  - Tear kale leaves off the ribs into bite-sized pieces and place in a bowl.
    Sprinkle a dash of sea salt over the kale and lightly scrunch handfuls of
    the kale. Continue until the kale becomes darker and more fragrant.
  - Clean and shred the brussels sprouts with a knife or food processor and add
    to the kale.
  - In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the tahnini, vinegar, miso, maple
    syrup, and red pepper flakes. Whisk in the water until the texture is
    smooth and creamy. Add a little more water if the tahini is especially
    thick. Pour dressing over the kale and sprouts.
  - In a small pan over low heat, toast the almond slivers, stirring
    frequently, until fragrant and golden. This should take less than five
    minutes. Add the toasted almonds and parmesan cheese to the salad. Toss and
    serve immediately.
