procedure:
  - Whisk the yeast into 1.5c 95-100ยบF water. Allow to sit for 1 minute.
  - Add salt, brown sugar, and melted butter and whisk to combine. Mixing with
    wooden spoon or dough hook, add 3c of flour a cup at a time until dough is
    thick. Add 3/4c more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. If it is
    still sticky, add up to 1/4c more. The dough is ready to knead when it
    bounces back when poked.
  - Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 3 minutes.
  - Shape the dough into a ball and proof for 10 minutes.
  - Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
  - With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 6 sections and roll each into a
    20-inch rope. Cut each rope into 1 1/2-inch pieces to make the bites.
  - Boil the baking soda in 9 cups of water in a large pot. Cook the bites, 8-10
    at a time, for 20 seconds. Remove the bites with a slotted spoon or spider
    and place onto baking sheets leaving space between each bite.
  - Apply egg wash to each bite and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake each batch in
    425ยบ oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown.
  - Serve with cheddar cheese sauce or honey mustard.
