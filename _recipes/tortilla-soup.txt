procedure:
  - In a medium pot, heat 1 T olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and
    chile and cook until soft, 7-10 minutes.
  - Stir in the garlic, cumin, and chipotle, and cook for 1 minute.
  - Add the stock, tomatoes, chicken, and salt. Simmer for 20 minutes, breaking
    up the tomatoes with a spoon.
  - While the soup simmers, slice the tortillas into 1/2 inch wide strips,
    cutting the long center strips in half crosswise. Heat the remaining olive
    oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Drop in one tortilla strip
    to test.
  - When the oil is hot enough, fry the tortilla strips in small batches
    turning once with tongs until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes per batch.
    Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and immediately sprinkle with salt.
  - To plate, ladle the soup into warmed bowls and float a handful of tortilla
    strips in each. Top with a dollop of sour cream, diced avocado, sliced
    scallions, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges alongside.
