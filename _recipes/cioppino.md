procedure:
- section: Broth
  items:
   - Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook,
     stirring occasionally, until softened, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic, basil,
     oregano, and red pepper flakes; stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
     Remove pot from heat and add wine. Return pot to heat, bring to a boil, and
     cook until wine is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes with
     juices, crushing with your hands as you add them.
   - Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15–20 minutes. Add clam
     juice, parsley, bay leaves, and 8 cups water; season with salt and pepper.
     Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors meld, 10–15 minutes
     more. Discard parsley sprigs and bay leaves.
