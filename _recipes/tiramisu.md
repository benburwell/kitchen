procedure:
  - Combine boiling water, espresso powder, 1T sugar, and Tia Maria in a pie
    plate. Mix to dissolve sugar, then cool.
  - Combine egg yolks, Marsala, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar over a simmering
    double boiler. Beat with a handheld mixer until the mixture has tripled in
    volume, 5-8 minutes. Remove from heat. Beat in mascarpone until just
    combined.
  - Beat cream in a large bowl to stiff peaks.
  - Fold mascarpone mixture into whipped cream gently but thoroughly.
  - Dipping both sides of each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, line the
    bottom of a 13x9x3 baking pan with 18 ladyfingers in 3 rows, trimming the
    edges to fit if needed. Spread half of the mascarpone filling on top. Add
    another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers and add smooth over the rest of
    the mascarpone mixture.
  - Dust with cocoa, cover with clingfilm, and chill for at least 6 hours.
