procedure:
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until
    it is just shy of al dente (it should be slightly underdone as it will
    finish in the sauce). Drain well.
  - Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Place chickpeas in a large bowl and use a
    potato masher or fork to lightly mash them; they should be about half
    crushed.
  - Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and fry until
    golden brown, about 2 minutes.
  - Stir in onion, rosemary, chile flakes, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring
    occasionally, until the onion is soft, about 10 minutes.
  - Stir in chickpeas and cooking liquid or water. Bring to a simmer and cook
    gently until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
  - Stir in the pasta and parsley and cook until the pasta is done and coated
    by the sauce, about 1-2 minutes.
  - Toss in cheese, butter, lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle
    with olive oil and top with grated cheese before serving.
