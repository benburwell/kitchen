procedure:
  - Boil a pot of water. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the
    onions in 3 T olive oil until softener, about 5-8 minutes. Reduce heat as
    necessary to keep onions from browning.
  - Add zucchini, season generously with salt and pepper, and continue cooking,
    stirring occasionally until rather soft, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat.
  - Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle to pound garlic, basil, and a little salt
    into a rough paste (or use a mini food processor). Stir in 3 T olive oil.
  - Salt the pasta water and put in the pasta, stirring. Boil per directions but
    keep to just shy of al dente to finish in sauce. Drain pasta, reserving 1c
    of cooking water.
  - Add cooked pasta to zucchini in skillet and turn heat to medium-high. Add
    1/2 c cooking water, then ricotta, crushed red pepper, and lemon zest.
    Adjust seasonings as needed. Add a little more pasta water if needed. Add
    the basil paste and half the grated cheese and stir quickly to incorporate.
  - To plate, spoon pasta into warmed soup bowls and sprinkle with additional
    cheese.
