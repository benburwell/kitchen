title: Pulled Chicken
ingredients:
  - item: bone-in skin-on chicken thighs
    qty: 2
    unit: lb
  - item: garlic cloves
    qty: 4
    prep: coarsely chopped
  - item: smoked paprika
  - item: ground cumin
  - item: salt
  - item: freshly ground black pepper
  - item: canola oil
  - item: chicken broth
  - item: whole dried ancho chiles
    qty: 2
    prep: stems removed
  - item: tomato paste
    qty: 5.5
    unit: oz
  - item: chipotles in adobo
procedure:
  - Heat canola oil over medium high heat in a large saucepan. Add garlic and
    chicken thighs. Season chicken with smoked paprika, ground cumin, salt, and
    pepper. Cook the chicken, turning once, until it is lightly browned on each
    side.
  - Add chicken broth to cover, about 3-4 cups. Add the ancho chiles, bring to a
    boil, then reduce to a simmer. Braise until the chicken is tender and falls
    apart easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.
  - Transfer the chicken to a bowl, leaving the braising liquid in the saucepan.
    Once the chicken has cooled sufficiently, remove the skin and bones and use
    two forks to pull it apart.
  - Meanwhile, bring the braising liquid in the saucepan to a gentle boil. Stir
    in the tomato paste and chipotles in adobo. Cook until the volume has been
    reduced by about 50%. Lower heat to just keep warm. Use an immersion blender
    to form a thick sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste.
  - Add the pulled chicken back to the saucepan. Combine thoroughly and let
    warm.
