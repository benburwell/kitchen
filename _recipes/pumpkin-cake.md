    and 1T of the butter. Mash the squash and cook over low heat until the sugar
    has dissolved and the mixture is fairly firm, not watery. Remove from the
    heat and allow to cool.
  - Add all the remaining ingredients except the reserved butter. Using the
    butter, grease a 2-quart souffle dish and pour in the squash mixture.
  - Bake in a preheated moderate (350 F) oven until the cake is firm to the
    touch, about 1 hour.
  - An ounce of rum may be poured over the cake while it is still hot, if liked.
    Serve as a pudding from the souffle dish plain or with whipped or sour
    cream.
