    - Lift out clams. If there is no sand in the bottom of the container, they're ready to scrub and use. 
    - If there is sand, drain and rinse the container, fill with fresh cold salted water, and return clams for 30 more minutes.
    - Continue this process until water is clear and free of sand. 
  - section: Bacon Bread Crumbs
    items:
    - In a large skillet, cook 6oz diced bacon over medium-high heat, stirring, unitl fat has rendered and baon is brown and crisp, about 7 minutes. 
    - Stir in bread crumbs to evenly coat in bacon fat and cook, stirring and tossing, until bread crumbs are lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.
    - Transfer to a bowl to cool and lightly season with salt and pepper.
  - section: Clams
    items:
    - In a large saute pan, cook 2oz diced bacon over medium-high heat until fat has rendered and bacon is lightly browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. 
    - Stir in shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes if using. Cook, stirring, until shallots have softened, about 4 minutes. 
    - Add white wine and clams, cover, and cook, checking occasionally, until clams begin to open. Using tongs, transfer opened clams to a large bowl to cool, continuing to cover saute pan and checking for newly opened clams.
    - Some clams may only crack open. This is fine, just pry the shell fully open.
    - Uncover saute pan and cook, stirring, until wine and clam liquid have evaporated and the shallot-bacon mixture has become jammy. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
    - In a medium bowl, stir shallot-bacon mixture and 0.25c parsley into softened butter until thoroughly incorporated. SEason lightly with salt and pepper.
    - Working one at a time, pry off top shell of each clam and discard, making sure no shell fragments from hinge fall into the clams. Free each clam from bottom shell then set back in bottom shell and transfer to rimmed baking dish.
    - Using a butter knife, pack clam butter around and over each clam, sealing each into the bottom shell. 
    - Sprinkle a small amount of bacon bread crumbs on top of each clam, pressing lightly to adhere.
    - At this point, you can cover the baking sheet with plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 day before cooking. Leftover clam butter can be kept refridgerated for up to 1 week.
    - When ready to serve, put clams in a 450ยบ oven and cook until butter is melted and clams are fully heated through, 3-5 minutes. 
    - Stir remaining 0.25c parsley into bread crumbs then sprinkle a generous amount on top of each clam. Return to oven for 1 minute to warm bread crumbs.
    - Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
