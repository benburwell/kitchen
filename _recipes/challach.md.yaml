procedure:
  - Pour 0.25c of the lukewarm water into a large mixing bowl. Add 1 packed of active dry yeast and 1t of sugar to the bowl, stir to dissolve. Wait 10 minutes.
  - The yeast should be expanded and foamy.
  - Once the yeast has activated, add remaining 1.25c lukewarm water to the bowl along with the egg, egg yolks, honey, canola oil, and salt. Use a whisk to thoroughly blend the ingredients together.
  - Begin adding the flour to the bowl by half-cupfuls, stirring with a large spoon each time the flour is added. When mixture becomes too thick to stir, use hands to knead.
  - Continue to add flour and knead until it's smooth, elastic, and not sticky. If using raisins or chocolate chips, incorporate as you knead.
  - Place a saucepan full of water on the stove to boil.
  - Remove douch from bowl and wash the bowl. Grease the bowl with canola oil, push dough into bottom of bowl, flip over so both sides are slightly moistened by the oil.
  - Cover bowl with clean damp kitchen towel. Place bowl on middle rack of oven and place saucepan of boiling water below the bowl.
  - Close the oven but don't turn it on. Let the dough rise for 1 hour.
  - Take the bowl out and punch down the dough several times. Place back in the oven for another hour.
  - Take dough out of oven. Flour a smooth surface.
  - Punch dough down a few times then turn out onto floured surface. 
  - Knead for a few minutes, adding flour as needed to keep dough from feeling sticky.
  - Braid challach and place on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
  - Prepare egg wash by beating the egg, salt, and water until smooth. Brush a thin layer onto the visible surface of the challah.
  - Let the braid rise for 30-45 minutes. Dough is ready when you press a finger into the dough and the indentation stays rather than bouncing back.
  - Heat oven to 350ยบ.
  - Put challah in oven and bake for 20 minutes.
  - Take challah out, coat center of braid with another thin layer of egg wash.
  - Turn the tray 180ยบ and bake another 20 minutes, keeping an eye on it so it doesn't burn. Once it's browned well, cover with foil and continue cooking if needed. Remove foil for last 2 minuts of baking.
  - Take challah out of oven. Bread is done when the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. 
  - Let cool on baking sheet or wire cooling rack.
